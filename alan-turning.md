Alan Turing was a British mathematician whose ideas laid the groundwork for modern computing. In 1936 he introduced the concept of a “universal machine” — now known as the Turing machine — which showed that a simple, abstract machine could in principle carry out any computation that any computer can perform.  During World War II he helped break the German Enigma code by designing machines and methods to decrypt enemy messages, significantly aiding the Allied war effort.  After the war he also proposed what became known as the Turing Test — a way to ask whether a machine can “think” like a human — thereby helping found the field of artificial intelligence.
