Ada Lovelace was a innovative 19th-century mathematician who made foundational contributions to computing: in 1843 she translated an article about Charles Babbage’s proposed Analytical Engine and appended extensive personal notes, among which she described what is often regarded as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine (for computing Bernoulli numbers).  In doing so she recognized that a “machine” might do more than mere arithmetic — it could manipulate symbols and even, she speculated, compose music — thereby presaging modern ideas of general-purpose computing.
